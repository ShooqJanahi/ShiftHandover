The Shift Handover System is a web-based application designed to streamline the process of managing and documenting shift activities for supervisors. The system enables supervisors to securely log in,
claim upcoming shifts, document incidents, accidents, and manpower usage, and formally close their shifts with no further changes permitted. Upon closure, the system automatically generates a detailed PDF 
report summarizing all shift activities and shares it with relevant supervisors, ensuring seamless communication and operational continuity.

Key Features:
1) User Authentication: Secure login for shift supervisors to access the system.
2) Shift Claiming: Prevents multiple supervisors from editing the same shift.
3) Shift Logging: Captures accidents, incidents, and manpower records with timestamps and descriptions.
4) Shift Closing: Locks the shift to ensure no edits after handover.
5) PDF Report Generation: Automatically creates a professional shift report using QuestPDF.
